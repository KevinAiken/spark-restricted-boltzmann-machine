# Spark Restricted Boltzmann Machine

A restricted Boltzmann machine implemented with Spark for GSU's Big Data course

MNIST Dataset is from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

For MNIST data download all 4 files from the data set and extract them. Then run idxToCsv.py to convert them
to csv's to so they can be used easily by the SparkMNIST.py program.

For this specific program I manually removed the first column.
